				<p> This is a website that serves two purposes: an online art portfolio and showcasing my Girls Who Code Projects! The Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program is a 7-week intensive computer science course that embeds classrooms in technology companies and universities. Girls learn everything from robotics to mobile development to HTML and CSS while gaining exposure to the tech industry and receiving valuable mentorship from women working in technology. </p>
				<p> In order to find out more about the program, click the logo below:

				<p> I've been taking art classes since kindergarten. Starting from just a sharpie and a large piece of paper, I developed my art skills and have dabbled in many different kinds of media, from using colored pencils for sketch to oil paint for color shaping. Every week for two hours, I practice these skills under my gracious teacher, Christine Chen.

					<p> In the first week, we learned about simple animations in Javascript. Using the 
						Khan academy environment, we learned how the loop function worked and how to make objects move 
						across the screen. For this unit, I paired up with Audrey to make a simple fish tank.
						<br><br>

					</p>
					<p> We also made programs that simulated Jackson Pollock's splatter paintings.
						<br><br>
						<IMG id = "splatter" SRC ="Images/splatterpainting.PNG" width = 300;></IMG>
					</p>
					<p> Then, we got into larger groups and made a city scroller assignment. We were assigned to make a
						background that would continuously scroll, creating a scene.
						<br><br>
						<IMG id = "cityScroller" SRC = "Images/city scroller.jpg" width = 300;></IMG>
						<br><br>
						In addition, we made it a game where a bear collects honeys and avoids aliens. I created and animated
						the front layer ( the moon ) and the bear! 
					</p>
					<p> During the second week, were exposed to a new language, Python, and used that to program small 
						robots called Scribblers. In groups of four, we worked to make our robots do something special. 
						<br><br> 
						<IMG id ="helloWorld" SRC="Images/helloworld.jpg" width = 400;></IMG>
						<br><br> 
						With Isabel, Jananni, and Vibha, I programmed the robot to write "Hello World" on a large piece of 
						poster paper while "beeping" the tune to Hello, Goodbye by the Beatles. 
					</p>
					<p> In order to become familiar with the Arduinos, we recreated the game Simon with the Arduinos. I worked with 
					Pratibha in this activity.
						<IMG id ="Simon" SRC="Images/simon.jpg" width = 400;></IMG>
					</p>
					<p> This was Pratibha, Shweta, and my Tic-Tac-Toe project! It was the second project made using the Arduino kits.
						<br><br>

							</A> 
						<br> 
						In this project, we were given the choice of making anything out of the arduino kits. This project 
						proved to be difficult because we did not have any port extendors, limiting us to the 13 pins to control the 
						9 LED lights and two buttons.
