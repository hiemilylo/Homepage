				<p> Hello! This website serves as my online art portfolio
					 and as a record of Girls Who Code Projects! The Girls Who Code Summer
					  Immersion Program is a 7-week intensive computer science course that
						 embeds classrooms in technology companies and universities. Girls
						  learn everything from robotics to mobile development to HTML and
							 CSS while gaining exposure to the tech industry and receiving
							 valuable mentorship from women working in technology.
				</p>
				<p> Click the logo below to find out more about the program:

				<p> I've been taking art classes since kindergarten. Starting from just
					a sharpie, blank piece of scratch paper, and a large imagination, I
					developed my art skills and dabbled in many different kinds of media,
					from using colored pencils for sketch to oil paint for color shaping.
					Every week for two hours, I practice these skills under my gracious
					teacher and mentor, Christine Chen.

					<p> In the first week of the GWC program, we learned about simple animations in
						Javascript. Using the Khan academy environment, we simulated Jackson Pollock's splatter paintings.
						<br><br>
						<IMG id = "splatter" SRC ="Images/splatterpainting.PNG" width = 300;></IMG>
					</p>
					<p> Then, we got into larger groups and made a city scroller
						assignment. We were assigned to make a background that would
						continuously "scroll", creating a scene.
						<br><br>
						<IMG id = "cityScroller" SRC = "Images/city scroller.jpg" width = 300;></IMG>
						<br><br>
						In addition, we made it a game where a bear collects honeys and
						avoids aliens. I created and animated the front layer (the moon)
						and the bear!
					</p>
					<p> During the second week, were exposed to a new language, Python, and used that to program small
						robots called Scribblers. In groups of four, we worked to make our robots do something special.
						<br><br>
						<IMG id ="helloWorld" SRC="Images/helloworld.jpg" width = 400;></IMG>
						<br><br>
						With Isabel, Jananni, and Vibha, I programmed the robot to write "Hello World" on a large piece of
						poster paper while "beeping" the tune to Hello, Goodbye by the Beatles.
					</p>
					<p> In order to become familiar with the Arduinos, we recreated the game Simon with them. I worked with
						Pratibha in this activity.
						<IMG id ="Simon" SRC="Images/simon.jpg" width = 400;></IMG>
					</p>
					<p> This was Pratibha, Shweta, and my Tic-Tac-Toe project! It was the second project made using the Arduino kits.
						<br><br>
						<IMG id ="tictactoe" SRC="Images/TicTacToe picture.jpg" width = 400;></IMG>
					</A>
					<br>
					In this project, we were given the choice of making anything out of the arduino kits. This project
					proved to be difficult because we did not have any port extendors, limiting us to the 13 pins to control the
					9 LED lights and two buttons.
				</p>
				<p>
					We then became familiar with Javascript and jQuery through replicating the 2048 game, shown in this live demo.

				<p>Hi! I'm Emily Lo, an freshman purusing a Computer Science
					degree at Carnegie Mellon University's School of Computer Science.
					I enjoy spending time with my family, drawing, singing, and of course
					 coding. I made this website as a part of the Girls Who Code Summer
